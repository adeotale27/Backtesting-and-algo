"""SQLite persistence for Position Guard's per-symbol ignore list.

Tracks symbols the user has reviewed and dismissed from the Position Guard
dashboard. An ignore is scoped to the exact set of orders/GTTs/position that
contributed to the symbol's long exposure at the time it was ignored (via a
fingerprint) — if that set changes at all, the ignore is treated as stale and
the symbol reappears automatically.

DB file: position_guard.db (created on first use).
